### Useful resources

- [Utopia Clamp Calculator](https://utopia.fyi/clamp/calculator/?a=0,0) - This tool helped me generate responsive font sizes using the `clamp()` function.
- [Getting started with Variable fonts on the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVymQ7SZw0) - This video by Kevin Powell was a great introduction to variable fonts.
- [Cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/#thepseudocontenttrick) â€“ This article by "Inclusive components" that was shared on Frontend Mentor's Discord helped me make the whole card clickable.
